# BioSeqFeatureExtraction

BioSeqFeatureExtraction is a comprehensive Python toolkit designed for the extraction and analysis of various biochemical and physicochemical features from protein sequences. Utilizing data from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database and the Amino Acid index database, this tool calculates a wide array of descriptors including monopeptide and dipeptide frequencies, along with physicochemical properties such as mass, length, free energy, and more. Aimed at facilitating bioinformatics research, this repository provides essential tools for understanding protein functions, interactions, and properties, making it invaluable for computational biology, toxicogenomics, and protein engineering studies.
